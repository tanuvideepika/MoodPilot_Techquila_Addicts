Problem Statement:

* Today, a majority of people suffer from mental health
issues. Often, such people remain in their chaotic
state of mind as they have no one to talk or check up
on them.
* Talking about mental health is still considered a stigma
in our society.
* Most people are unaware of their anxiety or
dopamine triggers and do not keep a track of their
mood swings.

Our Solution:

We came up with the idea of a mood pilot that provides a
safe space for the users to rant and express themselves
freely. The web app suggests activities to improve their
mood. It is the friend that checks up on the user when no
one else does and lets them keep a track of their mood
patterns over time.
